Improvements for Credit.c

1. Change method by which we get 2nd to last digit & every other digit before
    - Use while (cc_num > 0) loop w/ bool isAlternateDigit
    - Make sure new method works for all inputs (16 digit, 15 digit, and 13 digit cc_nums)
    - Combine steps: Every other digit function & multiplications for stage1_sum function
