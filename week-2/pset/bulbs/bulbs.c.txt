Bulbs.c Pseudocode

Objectives:
- Convert characters in user input to ASCII decimals
- Converting ASCII decimals to binary (using base-2)
- Turn bulbs on & off (implemented in print_bulb function)

Implementation:
1. Get user input
2. Iterate through each character in user input string
3. Get ASCII value of character by passing it as an int
4. Convert to base-2
	- If ASCII value is two or three digit, split it
	- First divide ASCII by 2; if no remainder then far-right bit = 0
	- Then divide by 2 again and again again until ASCII number is 0
	- Store each product in int array
5. Iterate over each bit, and send to print_bulb function
