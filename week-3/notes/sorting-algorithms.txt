Sorting Algorithms
---------------------
SELECTION SORT
Pseudocode:
    for i from 0 to n-1
        Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
        Swap smallest number with numbers[i]

--------------------------------------
BUBBLE SORT
Pseudocode:
    Repeat n-1 times
        For i from 0 to n-2
        If numbers[i] and numbers[i+1] out of order
            Swap them
